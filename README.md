## Concept:
Our gaol in devloping this app was to be able to check campsites and rec areas near me. First you are introduced to a login page where you are able to create a new user or login if you are a returning user. Then you are led to    
the main page where you are able to search for rec areas near you and you are able to wriet a review. Also from the main page, you can go to your profile page and look at your calender for events close to you.
